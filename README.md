# ML-image_reduction_and_grouping
On the website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/11785-spring2021-hw2p2s1-face-classification there is an experimental dataset consisting of real face images, which was recently used as the subject of a competition in the Kaggle environment. Overall there are 64x64 color (RGB) images of 4,000 faces and for each face there are several copies of the same face (with different angles, brightness, etc.). For the purposes of the exercise, use (randomly) 10 of the existing faces (i.e. Îš=10 categories) and for each face (category) use 50 images (most of the faces have more than 50 images). So in total, you will have a total of 10 x 50 = 500 images of K = 10 different faces. The point is to reduce the data using PCA method and group the examples into 10 groups considering one group for each face image using k-means algrotithm. To evaluate the clustering we used Purity and F-measure.
